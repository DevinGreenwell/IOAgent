COMMERCIAL FISHING VESSEL LEGACY (O.N. 530648), CREWMEMBER DEATH NEAR WARREN CHANNEL, ALASKA ON 01 AUGUST 2023
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
On 01 August 2023, at approximately 0615 local time, the commercial fishing vessel LEGACY departed for seine fishing operations near Point Warde in Southeast Alaska with five crew members - four aboard the main vessel and one crew member operating the seine skiff. During their third seine set of the day at approximately 0615, the vessels were working to maneuver the deployed seine net along the shoreline when the seine skiff ran aground on an outcrop of rocks. As the grounded skiff began to heel over due to tension from the seine net, the captain instructed the skiff operator to release the net using the quick release device. When the quick release mechanism was activated, the skiff violently recoiled from the sudden change in tension, ejecting the crew member into the water.
The LEGACY crew attempted recovery of the crew member as quickly as possible, estimating an in-water time of no more than five minutes. When they reached him, the crew member was face down and unresponsive, not wearing a life jacket despite one being available in the skiff. The crew immediately began cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and continued resuscitation efforts for approximately one and a half hours, including the use of automated external defibrillators provided by a Good Samaritan vessel. Emergency medical services transported the crew member to Wrangell Medical Center, where he was pronounced deceased.
Through its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the seine skiff running aground on the rock outcrop. Causal factors that contributed to this casualty include: (1) crew member's limited familiarity with local fishing operations, (2) the failure to maintain adequate distance from shore obstacles, (3) the absence of tension-dampening release systems that could have prevented the violent vessel recoil when the emergency net release was activated, and (4) crew member's decision not to wear the available personal flotation device during skiff operations, which significantly reduced survival chances after entering the water.

4. Findings of Fact
4.1. The Incident:
4.1.1. On 01 August 2023, at approximately 0600, the LEGACY and its five-person crew consisting of a master (Joseph CISNEY) and four crew members departed for commercial seine fishing operations in Warren Channel near Prince of Wales Island, Alaska. The crew had already completed two seine sets that morning, and all aspects of operations were considered normal by the crew who had conducted similar fishing operations throughout the season.
4.1.2. At approximately 0615, the LEGACY and seine skiff began their third seine set of the day near Point Warde. The seine net was fully deployed in the water and secured on either end to the LEGACY and the seine skiff. The skiff was equipped with a quick release device to release the net in case of emergency.
4.1.3. At approximately 0615, crew member Paul KAVON was operating the seine skiff, attempting to navigate parallel with the LEGACY while trying to stay near the shoreline. Mr. KAVON maintained radio communications with Captain CISNEY throughout operations.
4.1.4. At approximately 0615, Mr. KAVON radioed to Captain CISNEY that the seine skiff was too close to shore and in danger of running aground on an outcrop of rocks. He requested the captain use the attached net to pull the seine skiff to port, away from the shoreline.
4.1.5. Captain CISNEY quickly maneuvered the LEGACY away from the shoreline as requested in an attempt to direct the seine away from running aground. However, the seine skiff with Mr. KAVON onboard ran aground on the outcrop of rocks near the shoreline.
4.1.6. As the net connection between LEGACY and the skiff came under tension due to the skiff being hard aground and the LEGACY continuing to maneuver away from it, the skiff began to heel over due to the pulling force on the net. Captain CISNEY noticed this and radioed Mr. KAVON to "let go of the net."
4.1.7. Mr. KAVON complied and actuated the quick release mechanism on the skiff-end of the seine net, separating the seine from the net under tension. When the net released, the skiff violently recoiled from the sudden change in tension, ejecting Mr. KAVON into the water.
4.1.8. Captain CISNEY attempted to radio Mr. KAVON but received no response. He then noticed Mr. KAVON's blue raincoat floating in the water. The captain quickly maneuvered LEGACY to Mr. KAVON's location and observed him floating with arms and shoulders on top of the water with face submerged.
4.1.9. At approximately 0620, crew member John SHEA recovered Mr. KAVON from the water. The crew estimated Mr. KAVON was in the water for no more than five minutes. Upon recovery, Mr. KAVON was face down and unresponsive.
4.1.10. Crew member SHEA, a prior Marine Corps corpsman, immediately began administering cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). The F/V RESTLESS II arrived on scene as a Good Samaritan vessel and provided two automated external defibrillators (AED). The crew attempted to utilize both AEDs to shock Mr. KAVON, but each time the devices displayed "do not shock" messages.
4.1.11. The crew continued with CPR for approximately one and a half hours with no pulse detected on Mr. KAVON. At approximately 0800, Mr. KAVON's body was delivered to the Alaska State Troopers in Wrangell, Alaska for transfer to the State of Alaska Medical Examiner's Office.
4.1.12. On 18 August 2023, an autopsy was performed by the State of Alaska Medical Examiner. The cause of death was determined to be drowning, and manner of death as accidental.
4.1.13. Both the master and all surviving crew members accomplished post-casualty drug and alcohol testing in accordance with 46 CFR Subpart 4.06. All test results were negative.
4.2. Additional/Supporting Information:
4.2.1. The LEGACY was a 48.4-foot uninspected commercial fishing vessel built in 1971 in Blaine, Washington. The vessel was owned and operated by Joseph CISNEY out of Petersburg, Alaska. The vessel was utilized for commercial seine fishing operations in Southeast Alaska waters.
4.2.2. Mr. Paul KAVON was a 64-year-old male who had previous work history with Captain CISNEY. He was solicited by the Captain to assist with the 2023 fishing season due to his competence, knowledge, and ability to work the seine skiff autonomously. However, Mr. KAVON lived out of the area and was not consistently engaged in commercial fishing operations before this incident.
4.2.3. At the time of the incident, Mr. KAVON was on several medications and medical treatments, including those used to treat hypertension, diabetes, insomnia and sleep apnea. He was reportedly struggling with the physical demands of deck work leading up to the incident.
4.2.4. The observed weather conditions at the time of this incident were favorable with calm seas and good visibility. Weather was not considered a contributing factor to this casualty.
4.2.5. The seine skiff was equipped with a standard mechanical quick release device that did not incorporate any tension-dampening features. When activated under load, the device provided instant release without any mechanism to gradually reduce tension.
4.2.6. A personal flotation device (life jacket) was available in the seine skiff at the time of the incident. However, Mr. KAVON was not wearing the life jacket when he entered the water.
4.2.7. Post-mortem toxicology testing performed on Mr. KAVON was negative for both drugs and alcohol.
5. Analysis
5.1. Initiating Event: Seine Skiff Running Aground
The investigation determined that the initiating event for this casualty was the seine skiff running aground on the rock outcrop near the shoreline at approximately 0615 on 01 August 2023.
5.2. Causal Factors - Production:
5.2.1. Failure to maintain adequate distance from shore obstacles. Mr. KAVON navigated the skiff too close to the shoreline and was unable to react quickly enough to avoid running aground. Despite maintaining radio communications with Captain CISNEY and recognizing the danger, the skiff's proximity to shore left insufficient margin for error. It is reasonable to believe if the skiff had maneuvered further away from hazards, it may not have run aground.
5.3. Causal Factors - Preconditions:
5.3.1. Limited familiarity with local fishing operations. Mr. KAVON lived out of the area and was not consistently engaged in commercial fishing operations before this incident. It is reasonable to believe his extended absence from both the area and trade may have affected his judgment and reaction to elevated risk. His unfamiliarity with the specific hazards and conditions of the local waters likely contributed to the inadequate distance maintained from shore.
5.4. Causal Factors - Defense (Failed or Missing):
5.4.1. Absence of tension-dampening release systems. The skiff was equipped with a standard mechanical quick release device that did not compensate for line under tension. When the emergency release was activated while the net was under significant tension from the grounded skiff and the maneuvering LEGACY, the sudden release of energy caused the skiff to violently recoil. It's reasonable to believe if the device had incorporated a tension-dampening design, the vessel may not have recoiled with sufficient force to eject Mr. KAVON from the skiff.
5.4.2. Failure to wear available personal flotation device. Although there was a life jacket present in the skiff, Mr. KAVON was not wearing it during skiff operations. When he was ejected into the water, the absence of personal flotation significantly reduced his survival chances. Had Mr. KAVON been wearing the available life jacket, it may have prevented the drowning by keeping his airway above water until rescue.
5.5. Non-Causal Factors:
5.5.1. Medical conditions and medications. While Mr. KAVON was being treated for multiple medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes, insomnia, and sleep apnea, and was reportedly struggling with the physical demands of deck work, the investigation found no evidence that these conditions directly contributed to the grounding or his ejection from the vessel. The autopsy confirmed drowning as the cause of death with no indication that a medical event precipitated the casualty.
