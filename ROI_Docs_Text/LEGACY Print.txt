On 01 August 2023 at approximately 0630 local time, a crew member aboard the commercial fishing 
vessel LEGACY died while conducting commercial fishing operations in Warren Channel near Prince of 
Wales Island, Alaska. 
The crew of LEGACY was running out the net for the 3 rd set of the day. The crew member operating the 
skiff, hereafter referred to as crew member 1, radioed to the master of LEGACY that the skiff was too 
close to the rocks along the shoreline. The master attempted to use the net, already attached to the 
seine skiff, as a tow line and proceeded to pull the skiff under LEGACY's power. The master noticed 
that the skiff was beginning to heel so he instructed crew member 1 to release the net. Crew member 1 
complied and actuated the quick release mechanism, which caused the skiff to pitch suddenly with the 
loss of tension imparted by the net. The master radioed back to crew member 1 but received no 
response. Soon thereafter, the master noticed crew member 1's blue raincoat floating in the water. The 
master quickly maneuvered LEGACY to crew member 1's location and observed crew member 1 
floating with arms and shoulders on top of the water with face submerged. Another crew member 
aboard LEGACY recovered crew member 1 and commenced cardio pulmonary resuscitation (CPR). 
Another nearby vessel arrived on scene and provided 2 automated external defibrillators (AED). The 
crew attempted to utilize both AEDs to shock crew member 1, but each time the devices displayed "do 
not shock" messages. The crew continued with CPR for approximately an hour and a half with no pulse 
detected on crew member 1. Crew member 1's body was delivered to the Alaska State Troopers in 
Wrangell, Alaska for transfer to the State of Alaska Medical Examiners Office. 
As a result of its preliminary investigation, the Coast Guard has determined this incident is reportable 
under 46 CFR 4.05-1. Level of investigative effort will be ENHANCED.

On 01 August 2023, at approximately 0615  local time, the fishing vessel LEGACY was conducting seine 
fishing operations near Point Warde in Southeast Alaska with four crew members aboard the main 
vessel and one crew member, hereafter referred to as "crew member 1," operating the seine skiff. 
During their third seine set of the day, the vessels were working to maneuver the deployed seine net 
along the shoreline when the seine skiff ran aground on an outcrop of rocks. As the grounded skiff 
began to heel over due to tension from the seine net, the captain instructed crew member 1 to release 
the net using the quick release device. When the quick release mechanism was activated, the skiff 
violently recoiled from the sudden change in tension, ejecting crew member 1 into the water.
The LEGACY crew attempted recovery of crew member 1  as quickly as possible, estimating an in-water 
time of no more than five minutes. When they reached him, crew member 1 was face down and 
unresponsive, not wearing a life jacket despite one being available in the skiff. The crew immediately 
began cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and continued resuscitation efforts for approximately one 
and a half hours, including the use of automated external defibrillators provided by a Good Samaritan 
vessel. Emergency medical services transported crew member 1 to Wrangell Medical Center, where he 
was pronounced deceased.
As a result of its investigation, the Coast Guard determined that the initiating event for this casualty was 
the seine skiff running aground on the rock outcrop. Causal factors that contributed to this casualty 
include: (1) crew member 1's limited familiarity with local fishing operations, and (2) the failure to 
maintain adequate distance from shore obstacles, (3) the absence of tension-dampening release 
systems that could have prevented the violent vessel recoil when the emergency net release was 
activated, and (4) Crew member 1's decision not to wear the available personal flotation device during 
skiff operations, which significantly reduced survival chances after entering the water.

II.VII CORRESPONDENCE
Page 31 of  36 Case Number: 1362282
II.VIII CONCLUSIONS – PART 1. CAUSE
Initiating Event:
Grounding (01Aug2023 14:15:40 Z)
Failures of Defense Against Subsequent Events in the Incident
Subsequent Event # 1:
Personnel Ejected from Vessel (01Aug2023 14:16:10 Z)
Defense Factors
Missing - Absence of tension dampening in the quick release system.
The skiff was equipped with a standard mechanical quick release device that did not 
compensate for line under tension. It's reasonable to believe if the device had a tension 
dampening design, the vessel may not have recoiled against the release, thus 
preventing crew member 1 from being ejected from the skiff.
Condition/Environment - Working Environment(01Aug2023 14:15:55Z); 
Warren Channel, Alaska; The net connection between LEGACY and its skiff 
was under tension due to the skiff being hard aground and the LEGACY 
continuing to maneuver away from it. ; LEGACY
Subsequent Event # 2:
Personnel Casualty - Death (01Aug2023 14:30:00 Z)Precondition
Mismatch - Between Person and Environment - Limited familiarity with local fishing operations.
     Crew member 1 lived out of the area and was not consistently engaged in commercial fishing 
operations before this incident. It is reasonable to believe his extended absence from both area and 
trade may have affected his judgement and reaction to elevated risk.      
Condition/Person - Person Condition (01Aug2023 08:01:00 Z); Warren Channel, Alaska; Crew 
member 1 was a 64 year old male who had a previous work history with the Captain of LEGACY. 
He was solicited by the Captain to assist with the 2023 fishing season due to his competence, 
knowledge, and ability to work the seine skiff autonomously. At the time of the incident, he was on 
several medications and medical treatments, including those used to treat hypertension, diabetes, 
insomnia and sleep apnea. He was reportedly struggling with the physical demands of deck work 
leading up to the incident. ; PAUL KAVON
Production
Execution Error – Attention Failure - Failure to maintain adequate distance from shore obstacles.
     Crew member 1 navigated the skiff too close to the shoreline, and was unable to react quickly 
enough to avoid running aground. It is reasonable to believe if the skiff had maneuvered further away 
from hazards, it may not have run aground.      
Action/Bridge Operations - Shiphandling (01Aug2023 14:00:05 Z); Warren Channel, Alaska; Crew 
member 1 navigated the skiff in parallel with the LEGACY while trying to stay near the shoreline 
and away from shoal water. ; PAUL KAVON
Action/Communications (01Aug2023 14:15:20 Z); Warren Channel, Alaska; Crew member 1 
maintained radio communications with the LEGACY captain throughout operations, relaying that the 
skiff was too close to shore and in danger of running aground on an outcrop of rocks. He requested 
the captain use the attached net to pull the siene skiff to port, away from the shoreline.; JOE 
CISNEY, PAUL KAVON
Action/Bridge Operations - Shiphandling (01Aug2023 14:15:30 Z); Warren Channel, Alaska; The 
captain quickly maneuvered the LEGACY away from the shoreline as requested in an attempt to 
direct the seine away from running aground. ; JOE CISNEY
Page 32 of  36 Case Number: 1362282
II.IX CONCLUSIONS – PART 2. ENFORCEMENT REFERRALS
None
II.X SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS
Safety Alerts:Defense Factors
Missing - Missing personal flotation device during skiff operations.
Although there was a life jacket present in the skiff, Crew member 1 was not wearing it 
during skiff operations. It is reasonable to believe if Crew member 1 had been wearing 
the life jacket, it may have prevented the drowning.
Condition/Person - Person Condition(01Aug2023 14:20:00Z); Warren Channel, 
Alaska; Crew member 1 was recovered face down in the water with arms and 
shoulders floating on the surface of the water. ; PAUL KAVON

Notification Method: VHF/FM (Channel 16) voice
Incident Summary:  010730U AUG 23: SCC Juneau received notification from the F/V LEGACY that one 
of their crew members had fallen into the water off the sein skiff that the member was operating at 
0635 local. The patient was reported to be unresponsive, and CPR was being administered. A good 
Sam vessel in the area responded to the incident and delivered two AEDs. Both AEDs returned a "do 
not shock" message and to continue with CPR. SCC contacted Wrangell SAR and ASTs to initiate 
response as well as launched a helo asset from AIRSTA Sitka. SCC briefed DFS on the situation and 
conferenced in another crew member from the LEGACY, who was a prior Marine Corpsman and 
directing medical response to the patient on scene. The Corpsman confirmed there was no pulse, and 
the patient remains unresponsive after 1 hour of CPR. DFS recommended to cease CPR as all Other Activities (Non IMA or Non Sortie) in Case:

information suggested that further medical treatment would be futile. The good Sam departed the 
scene and the F/V LEGACY began to return to Wrangell and plans to meet Wrangel SAR in route to 
transfer the patient. SCC Juneau notified MSD Ketchikan. MSD Ketchikan will make marine casualty 
determination. Case Closed for SAR; Case Pends for MS.

with the DFS (LCDR Eastman). LCDR Eastman recommended the helo does not conduct a hoist and to 
stop CPR.
