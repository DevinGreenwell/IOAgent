AnalysisThe following analysis examines the causal factors that contributed to this marine casualty. Each factor is supported by findings of fact documented in Section 4 above.5.1. Inadequate voyage-risk-assessment oversight1) The USCG MCI-O3B process expects owners/masters to carry out a written risk assessment whenever operations are conducted in confined or shoal waters. No documentation or verbal evidence indicates that such an assessment was prepared for the day’s sets, suggesting that risk identification and mitigation were left to real-time judgement. 2) Because the hazards of rocky outcrops and strong tidal currents around Point Warde are charted and well-known locally, an effective risk assessment would have required the captain either to set the seine farther off the beach or to establish a minimum clearance distance and abort criteria for the skiff. 3) Without these organizational controls, the skiff operator continued to work on the edge of the shoal area, culminating in the grounding. 4) Industry standards (e.g., 46 CFR 28.265 and ISM Code §7) call for a formal voyage plan and risk assessment; their absence removed an important management barrier that should precede every set. 5) This omission directly enabled the sequence that caused the skiff to ground, satisfying the Swiss-cheese ‘Organization’ slice for the initiating event. This organization factor directly contributed to the marine casualty by creating conditions that allowed the incident sequence to proceed and prevented effective mitigation of the hazard.Category: Organization Factor5.2. Lack of accurate shoal-depth information1) Seine skiffs are often fitted with only rudimentary instrumentation; there is no evidence of a depth sounder or electronic chart plotter aboard the skiff. It is reasonable to assume that the operator relied on visual cues and local knowledge. 2) The rock outcrop was awash at high tide; without depth data or alarms, the operator received no advance notice of decreasing under-keel clearance. 3) This workplace deficiency meant the operator’s sole defense was line-of-sight judgement, which is degraded when the vessel is positioned stern-tow to the net and the operator must divide attention between the beach, the net, and radio communications. 4) IMO Resolution A.893(21) and NVIC 02-16 encourage suitable navigation equipment proportional to the risk; its absence removed a workplace barrier that could have averted the grounding. 5) Consequently, the skiff entered shoal water unchecked, directly causing the initiating event. This workplace factor directly contributed to the marine casualty by creating conditions that allowed the incident sequence to proceed and prevented effective mitigation of the hazard.Category: Workplace Factor5.3. Failure of physical impairment of skiff operator1) The operator was taking antihypertensive, antidiabetic, and sleep-related medication, any of which can cause dizziness or delayed reaction. Based on standard medical guidance (NVIC 04-08), such conditions require careful fitness-for-duty evaluation. 2) Crew fatigue is an established precursor in casualty analyses; it undermines vigilance and timely decision-making. It is likely that six hours of continuous fishing in physically demanding conditions exacerbated these effects. 3) Reduced alertness can explain why the operator did not detect or react to the encroaching rocky outcrop sooner, despite being an experienced skiff-man. 4) This precondition opened a hole in the human-factor layer of the Swiss-cheese model by degrading the effectiveness of remaining barriers (e.g., visual lookout, judgment). 5) Therefore, the operator’s impairment materially contributed to the grounding event.Category: Precondition Factor5.4. Failure of operator to maintain clearance1) Standard seine-skiff practice calls for maintaining a safe buffer from shore, typically at least twice the vessel’s draft plus a safety margin; the operator breached this norm. 2) By the time the operator radioed for assistance, the skiff was already in extremis, leaving little room for corrective action. 3) This unsafe act directly triggered the grounding once the inevitable contact with the outcrop occurred. 4) Existing safeguards—competence, visual lookout, and radio coordination—were undermined by the preconditions noted earlier. 5) Thus, the operator’s decision/action represents the ‘Production’ hole through which the incident propagated. This production factor directly contributed to the marine casualty by creating conditions that allowed the incident sequence to proceed and prevented effective mitigation of the hazard.Category: Production Factor5.5. Absence of proactive grounding-prevention barriers1) Effective defenses against grounding include clear abort parameters (e.g., minimum depth or distance), remote releases, and automatic weak links that part before structural damage occurs. None were in place. 2) The quick-release device was available but used reactively rather than proactively; this indicates procedural rather than hardware shortcomings. 3) Because the barrier was triggered too late, the skiff first grounded and then became subject to severe tension from the net’s pull, worsening the scenario. 4) Based on standard practice, the master should issue standing orders to release tow connections whenever depth alarms reach a set point; the absence of such orders removed a critical defense layer. 5) Consequently, the event chain moved unabated from hazard to initial consequence. This defense factor directly contributed to the marine casualty by creating conditions that allowed the incident sequence to proceed and prevented effective mitigation of the hazard.Category: Defense Factor5.6. Failure to properly address: Insufficient recoil-energy mitigation measures1) Quick-release devices are intended to sever the connection but must ideally be used before excessive tension builds. Here, release occurred with the line fully loaded. 2) No energy-absorbing snubber, controlled-pay-out drum, or procedural step (e.g., slackening the line from the LEGACY first) was employed, so the stored energy translated into violent recoil. 3) This missing barrier directly led to the operator’s loss of balance and ejection, progressing the casualty from material damage to a person-overboard situation. 4) Based on industry guidance (e.g., OCIMF mooring equipment guidelines), anti-snapback zones, shields, or controlled releases should be part of high-energy towing operations; their absence constituted a defense failure. 5) Thus, when the initiating event escalated, no effective safeguard arrested the kinetic hazard, enabling the subsequent event.Category: Defense Factor5.7. Lack of personal flotation-device usage1) 46 CFR 28.110 requires commercial fishing vessel crew on deck to wear PFDs when there is risk of falling overboard. No testimony or recovery notes mention a life-jacket; the body was found face-down, suggesting none was worn. 2) A properly fitted PFD would have kept the airway clear, buying crucial time for recovery and resuscitation. 3) The absence of this personal protective barrier allowed the water immersion to progress rapidly to drowning. 4) It is reasonable to assume that cultural norms or discomfort affected compliance, indicating a latent weakness in the vessel’s safety culture. 5) Consequently, once the operator entered the water, there was no effective last-line defense to prevent fatality. This defense factor directly contributed to the marine casualty by creating conditions that allowed the incident sequence to proceed and prevented effective mitigation of the hazard.Category: Defense Factor5.8. Failure to properly address: Insufficient man-overboard recovery response1) Best practice (e.g., AMSEA training guidelines) recommends throw-lines, recovery slings, and designated crew for MOB response; none are mentioned, and the timeline shows a gap of ~3.5 minutes between water entry and recovery. 2) Cold Alaskan waters can induce hypothermia and inhalation in seconds; every minute counts. 3) The ship maneuvered to recover the victim, but without specialized gear or drilled crew, the process was slower than optimal, diminishing chances of successful CPR. 4) This suggests that the vessel’s safety management system did not include regular MOB drills or readily deployable retrieval devices. 5) The inadequate defense allowed the drowning sequence to complete, resulting in fatality despite later medical efforts. This defense factor directly contributed to the marine casualty by creating conditions that allowed the incident sequence to proceed and prevented effective mitigation of the hazard.Category: Defense Factor6. Conclusions6.1. Determination of Cause:6.1.1. The investigation determined that inadequate voyage-risk-assessment oversight contributed to this incident by the company/captain did not conduct or document a formal risk assessment and safe routing plan for seine operations close to rocky shore, leaving the skiff operator without clear operational limits or contingency guidance..6.1.2. The investigation determined that lack of accurate shoal-depth information contributed to this incident by the skiff did not have real-time depth, chart-plotter, or audible shallow-water alarms, limiting the operator’s ability to detect the rock outcrop before grounding..6.1.3. The investigation determined that failure of physical impairment of skiff operator contributed to this incident by the operator’s age, multiple medications, and reported fatigue reduced his physical stamina and possibly his situational awareness during critical maneuvering..6.1.4. The investigation determined that failure of operator to maintain clearance contributed to this incident by the skiff operator continued to navigate parallel to shore in hazardous proximity, rather than aborting the set or repositioning earlier..6.1.5. The investigation identified multiple failed or absent safety barriers that contributed to this incident, including absence of proactive grounding-prevention barriers, insufficient recoil-energy mitigation measures, lack of personal flotation-device usage, and insufficient man-overboard recovery response.6.1.6. This incident resulted from a combination of 8 contributing factors across multiple categories of the causal analysis framework, demonstrating the complex interactions that can lead to marine casualties.6.2.
